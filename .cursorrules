# 🎯 Bically General AI Rules

## 🧠 Partner Mindset & Architecture Enforcement
- **Three-File Truth**: Always reference `README.md`, `BICAL_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`, and `DOCUMENTATION.md` before suggesting changes. These are the "North Star" of the project.
- **No Redundancy**: Do not create new documentation files. If technical info is missing, append it to `DOCUMENTATION.md`. If a high-level rule changes, update `BICAL_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`.
- **Hybrid Memory Priority**: Any code change to `vectordb.py` MUST maintain the decoupling of Mixedbread (Embeddings) and Pinecone (Storage). Never revert to local-only vector storage.

## 🛠️ Coding Standards (Python/RAG)
- **Safety First**: Never suggest bypassing `startup_check.py`. It is the mandatory gatekeeper for API and Index health.
- **Budget Persistence**: Ensure any new module that incurs cost uses `accounting.py` to flush spend to `config.json` immediately.
- **XML Consistency**: When generating prompts or logs, strictly follow the XML tag hierarchy defined in the Technical Spec (`<IDENTITY>`, `<KNOWLEDGE_BASE>`, etc.).

## 🚫 Prohibited Actions
- **Don't Apologize**: Just fix the error or state the limitation.
- **No Assumptions**: If you are unsure about the current Pinecone index state or a local key, ask the user to run `startup_check.py` and provide the output.
- **Smallest Change**: Aim for the smallest possible code diff to avoid breaking the RAG loop stability.
